# Introduction

This article illustrates how ``ddml`` can complement the highly popular [``did``](https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/index.html) package to compute group-time average treatment effects under a _conditional_ parallel trends assumption. The result is a doubly-robust difference-in-difference estimator for staggered treatment adoption designs that leverages machine learning and (short-)stacking to flexibly control for covariates -- or: difference-in-difference with machine learning.

For an excellent introduction to differences-in-differences with multiple time periods, see also [this article](https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/articles/multi-period-did.html). For a detailed discussion of the relevant asymptotic theory for double/debiased machine learning difference-in-difference estimators see Chang (2020).

# Estimation using ``did``'s Default Estimator

For illustration, consider the data of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) on county-level teen employment rates from 2003-2007 for additional details. We are interested in the effect of treatment on the log-employment rate ``lemp`` and assume that parallel trends holds conditional on county population (``lpop`` is the log of county population).


```r
# Load the did package
library(did)
set.seed(588239)

# Print the data
data(mpdta)
head(mpdta)
#>     year countyreal     lpop     lemp first.treat treat
#> 866 2003       8001 5.896761 8.461469        2007     1

```

By default, the group-time average treatment effect estimator of the ``did`` package controls _linearly_ for additional covariates. (In particular, the propensity score is estimated using [logistic regression](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/DRDID/blob/master/R/drdid_panel.R#L96) and the outcome reduced form is estimated via  [linear regression](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/DRDID/blob/master/R/drdid_panel.R#L107)). The below code snippet runs the default linear specification (similar to [this article](https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/articles/did-basics.html#an-example-with-real-data)).


```r
# Estimate group-time average treatment effects with covariates
attgt_lm <- att_gt(yname = "lemp",
                   gname = "first.treat",
                   idname = "countyreal",
                   tname = "year",
                   xformla = ~lpop,
                   data = mpdta)

The ``did`` package offers visualization methods using ``gglpot2``:

ggdid(attgt_lm, ylim = c(-.4, .4))

Further, the group-time average treatment effects can easily be aggregated, for example, to estimate dynamic average treatment effects:

# Contructing a ``xgboost``-based Diff-in-Diff Estimator

Without additional _parametric_ functional form assumptions on the reduced form equations, it is _not_ guaranteed that the default ``att_gt`` estimator returns a convex combination of causal effects. This is because linear predictors do not necessarily correspond to the conditional expectation functions arising in the doubly-robust score of the group-time average treatment effect. The resulting misspecification error can then lead to negative weights in the aggregation of individual-level treatment effects.

Fortunately, a convex combination of causal effects can be guaranteed (without parametric functional form assumptions) when using machine learning (nonparametric) reduced form estimators.

``ddml`` facilitates the use of a large set of machine learning reduced form estimators, including simultaneous considerations of multiple estimators via (short-)stacking.

To use ``ddml`` estimators with the ``did`` package, we can make use of the ``est_method`` argument of the ``att_gt`` function (see also ``?did::att_gt``). It is useful to construct this method in two steps:

1. A simple wrapper for ``ddml_att`` that returns the objects needed by ``att_gt``
2. A second wrapper that hard-codes arguments passed to ``ddml_att``

This two-step approach allows for cleaner code when considering multiple ddml-based estimators (as we do in this article).

The below code-snippet constructs a simple estimation method following step 1:

```r
# load the ddml package
library(ddml)

# write a general wrapper for ddml_att
ddml_did_method <- function(y1, y0, D, covariates, ...) {
  # Compute difference in outcomes
  delta_y <- y1 - y0
  # Compute the ATT
  att_fit <- ddml_att(y = delta_y, D = D, X = covariates, ...)
  # Return results
  inf.func <- att_fit$psi_b + att_fit$att * att_fit$psi_a
  output <- list(ATT = att_fit$att, att.inf.func = inf.func)
  return(output)
}#DDML_DID_METHOD
```

A potentially suitable machine learning reduced form estimator is gradient tree boosting (see also ``?mdl_xgboost``). The below code snippet completes the second wrapper by hard-coding both the learner and its arguments. Here, we consider 10-fold cross-fitting with a gradient tree boosting estimator (``eta`` is the learning rate, see also ``?mdl_xgboost``).


```r
my_did_xgboost <- function(y1, y0, D, covariates, ...) {
  # Hard-code learners
  learners = list(what = mdl_xgboost,
                  args = list(nround = 500,
                              params = list(eta = 0.05, max_depth = 3),
                              early_stopping_rounds = 1))
  learners_DX = learners

  # Call the general ddml_did method w/ additional hard-coded arguments
  ddml_did_method(y1, y0, D, covariates,
                  learners = learners,
                  learners_DX = learners_DX,
                  sample_folds = 10,
                  silent = TRUE)
}#MY_DID_XGBOOST
```

We can now use the reduced form estimator ``my_did_xgboost`` and pass it via the ``est_method`` argument:


```r
# estimate group-time average treatment effects with ddml
attgt_xgboost <- att_gt(yname = "lemp",
                        gname = "first.treat",
                        idname = "countyreal",
                        tname = "year",
                        xformla = ~lpop,
                        data = mpdta,
                        est_method = my_did_xgboost)

The gradient tree boosting-based ATT estimate is only slightly different from the ATT estimate using the linear estimator of the ``did`` package, however, it is statistically insignificant.

Given these two coefficients, is there a good reason to choose one over the other?

It is ex-ante difficult to trade-off the potential bias from misspecification that the linear estimator suffers from with the potential bias from estimation error that the gradient tree boosting estimator may suffer from. ``ddml`` allows to resolve this conflict in a data-driven manner by simultaneous consideration of multiple machine learners via (short-)stacking. We turn to this in the next section.

# Contructing a Shortstacking-based Diff-in-Diff Estimator

Instead of considering just a single machine learner -- that may or may not be suitable for the given application -- we can leverage (short-)stacking and simultaneously consider multiple machine learners. As in other settings, this substantially increases robustness to the underlying structure of the data.

We construct a new wrapper for our ``ddml_did_method`` that hard-codes different reduced form estimators:

- linear or logistic regression
- gradient tree boosting with more and less regularization
- random forests with more and less regularization

The reduced form estimators are then optimally combined via non-negative least squares. Note that this specification also includes the linear control specifications considered by the default ``did`` learner, ensuring that machine learners are not spuriously selected. We leverage shortstacking to reduce computational time (see also `vignette("stacking")`).


```r
my_did_stacking <- function(y1, y0, D, covariates, ...) {
  # Hard-code learners for outcome reduced-form
  learners = list(list(fun = ols),
                  list(fun = mdl_xgboost,
                       args = list(nround = 500,
                                   params = list(eta = 0.05, max_depth = 1),
                                   early_stopping_rounds = 1)),
                  list(fun = mdl_xgboost,
                       args = list(nround = 500,
                                   params = list(eta = 0.05, max_depth = 3),
                                   early_stopping_rounds = 1)),
                  list(fun = mdl_ranger,
                       args = list(num.trees = 1000,
                                   max.depth = 1)),
                  list(fun = mdl_ranger,
                       args = list(num.trees = 1000,

Finally, we recompute the group-time average treatment effects using our shortstacking estimator:


```r

                         tname = "year",
                         xformla = ~lpop ,
                         data = mpdta,
                         est_method = my_did_stacking)

The results are largely similar to those of the default linear estimator of the ``did`` package, suggesting that the linear approximation of the reduced forms is sufficiently accurate. (Of course we didn't know that before -- now, at least, we can sleep easy!)

Other settings, in particular settings with multiple control variables, may show starker difference in the final estimates.
