Description: Estimate common causal parameters using double/debiased machine 
    learning as proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/ectj.12097>. 
    'ddml' simplifies estimation based on (short-)stacking as discussed in 
    Ahrens et al. (2024) <doi:10.1177/1536867X241233641>, which leverages multiple base 
    learners to increase robustness to the underlying data generating process.
