Description: Estimate common causal parameters using double/debiased machine 
    learning as proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/ectj.12097>. 
    'ddml' simplifies estimation based on (short-)stacking, which leverages 
    multiple base learners to increase robustness to the underlying 
    data generating process.
