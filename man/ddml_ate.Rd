}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The outcome variable.}

\item{D}{Binary endogenous variable of interest.}

\item{X}{A (sparse) matrix of control variables.}

\item{learners}{May take one of two forms, depending on whether a single
learner or stacking with multiple learners is used for estimation of the
conditional expectation functions.
If a single learner is used, \code{learners} is a list with two named
elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{what} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{what}.}
}
If stacking with multiple learners is used, \code{learners} is a list of
lists, each containing four named elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{fun} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{fun}.}
\item{\code{assign_X} An optional vector of indices corresponding to
features in \code{X} that are passed to the corresponding base
learner.}
}}

\item{learners_DX}{Optional argument to allow for different estimators of
\eqn{E[D|X]}. Setup is identical to \code{learners}.}

\item{sample_folds}{Number of cross-fitting folds.}

\item{ensemble_type}{Ensemble method to combine base learners into final
estimate of the conditional expectation functions. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"nnls"} Non-negative least squares.}
\item{\code{"nnls1"} Non-negative least squares with the constraint
that all weights sum to one.}
\item{\code{"singlebest"} Select base learner with minimum MSPE.}
\item{\code{"ols"} Ordinary least squares.}
\item{\code{"average"} Simple average over base learners.}
}
Multiple ensemble types may be passed as a vector of strings.}

\item{shortstack}{Boolean to use short-stacking.}

\item{cv_folds}{Number of folds used for cross-validation in ensemble
construction.}

\item{subsamples_D0, subsamples_D1}{List of vectors with sample indices for
cross-fitting, corresponding to untreated and treated observations,
respectively.}

\item{cv_subsamples_list_D0, cv_subsamples_list_D1}{List of lists, each
corresponding to a subsample containing vectors with subsample indices
for cross-validation. Arguments are separated for untreated and treated
observations, respectively.}

\item{silent}{Boolean to silence estimation updates.}
}
\value{
\code{ddml_ate} returns an object of S3 class
\code{ddml_ate}. An object of class \code{ddml_ate} is a list containing
the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{ate}}{A vector with the average treatment effect
estimates.}
\item{\code{weights}}{A list of matrices, providing the weight
assigned to each base learner (in chronological order) by the
ensemble procedure.}
\item{\code{mspe}}{A list of matrices, providing the MSPE of each
base learner (in chronological order) computed by the
cross-validation step in the ensemble construction.}
\item{\code{learners},\code{learners_DX},
\code{subsamples_D0},\code{subsamples_D1},
\code{cv_subsamples_list_D0},\code{cv_subsamples_list_D1},
\code{ensemble_type}}{Pass-through of
selected user-provided arguments. See above.}

\details{
\code{ddml_ate} provides a double/debiased machine learning
estimator for the average treatment effect in the interactive model
given by

\eqn{Y = g_0(D, X) + U,}

where \eqn{(Y, D, X, U)} is a random vector such that
\eqn{\operatorname{supp} D = \{0,1\}}, \eqn{E[U\vert D, X] = 0}, and
\eqn{\Pr(D=1\vert X) \in (0, 1)} with probability 1,
and \eqn{g_0} is an unknown nuisance function.

In this model, the average treatment effect is defined as

\eqn{\theta_0^{\textrm{ATE}} \equiv E[g_0(1, X) - g_0(0, X)]}.
