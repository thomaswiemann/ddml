\title{Generic function to check for instrument selection of a trained model.}
\usage{
any_iv(obj, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A trained model.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for the identification of the instruments.
In most cases, the user should pass a vector of indices corresponding to
instruments among the features used by \code{obj} for prediction. When
\code{class(obj) == "boosting"}, the user should also pass a vector of
instrument names.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{TRUE} if at least one instrument is used for
    prediction, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
