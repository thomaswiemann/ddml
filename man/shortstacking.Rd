\title{Predictions using Short-Stacking.}
\usage{
shortstacking(
  y,
  X,
  Z = NULL,
  learners,
  sample_folds = 2,
  ensemble_type = "average",
  custom_ensemble_weights = NULL,
  compute_insample_predictions = FALSE,
  subsamples = NULL,
  silent = FALSE,
  progress = NULL,
  auxiliary_X = NULL,
  shortstack_y = y
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The outcome variable.}

\item{X}{A (sparse) matrix of predictive variables.}

\item{Z}{Optional additional (sparse) matrix of predictive variables.}

\item{learners}{May take one of two forms, depending on whether a single
learner or stacking with multiple learners is used for estimation of the
predictor.
If a single learner is used, \code{learners} is a list with two named
elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{what} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{what}.}
}
If stacking with multiple learners is used, \code{learners} is a list of
lists, each containing four named elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{fun} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{fun}.}
\item{\code{assign_X} An optional vector of column indices
corresponding to predictive variables in \code{X} that are passed to
the base learner.}
\item{\code{assign_Z} An optional vector of column indices
corresponding to predictive in \code{Z} that are passed to the
base learner.}
}
Omission of the \code{args} element results in default arguments being
used in \code{fun}. Omission of \code{assign_X} (and/or \code{assign_Z})
results in inclusion of all variables in \code{X} (and/or \code{Z}).}

\item{sample_folds}{Number of cross-fitting folds.}

\item{ensemble_type}{Ensemble method to combine base learners into final
estimate of the conditional expectation functions. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"nnls"} Non-negative least squares.}
\item{\code{"nnls1"} Non-negative least squares with the constraint
that all weights sum to one.}
\item{\code{"singlebest"} Select base learner with minimum MSPE.}
\item{\code{"ols"} Ordinary least squares.}
\item{\code{"average"} Simple average over base learners.}
}
Multiple ensemble types may be passed as a vector of strings.}

\item{custom_ensemble_weights}{A numerical matrix with user-specified
ensemble weights. Each column corresponds to a custom ensemble
specification, each row corresponds to a base learner in \code{learners}
(in chronological order). Optional column names are used to name the
estimation results corresponding the custom ensemble specification.}

\item{compute_insample_predictions}{Indicator equal to 1 if in-sample
predictions should also be computed.}

\item{subsamples}{List of vectors with sample indices for cross-fitting.}

\item{silent}{Boolean to silence estimation updates.}

\item{progress}{String to print before learner and cv fold progress.}

\item{auxiliary_X}{An optional list of matrices of length
\code{sample_folds}, each containing additional observations to calculate
predictions for.}

\item{shortstack_y}{Optional vector of the outcome variable to form
short-stacking predictions for. Base learners are always trained on
\code{y}.}
}
\value{
\code{shortstack} returns a list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{oos_fitted}}{A matrix of out-of-sample predictions,
each column corresponding to an ensemble type (in chronological
order).}
\item{\code{weights}}{An array, providing the weight
assigned to each base learner (in chronological order) by the
ensemble procedures.}
\item{\code{is_fitted}}{When \code{compute_insample_predictions = T}.
a list of matrices with in-sample predictions by sample fold.}
\item{\code{auxiliary_fitted}}{When \code{auxiliary_X} is not
\code{NULL}, a list of matrices with additional predictions.}
\item{\code{oos_fitted_bylearner}}{A matrix of
out-of-sample predictions, each column corresponding to a base
learner (in chronological order).}
\item{\code{is_fitted_bylearner}}{When
\code{compute_insample_predictions = T}, a list of matrices with
in-sample predictions by sample fold.}
\item{\code{auxiliary_fitted_bylearner}}{When \code{auxiliary_X} is
not \code{NULL}, a
list of matrices with additional predictions for each learner.}
}
Note that unlike \code{crosspred}, \code{shortstack} always computes
out-of-sample predictions for each base learner (at no additional
computational cost).
