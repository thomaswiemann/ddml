ddml_late(
  y,
  D,
  Z,
  X,
  learners,
  learners_DXZ = learners,
  learners_ZX = learners,
  sample_folds = 10,
  ensemble_type = "nnls",
  shortstack = FALSE,
  cv_folds = 10,
  custom_ensemble_weights = NULL,
  custom_ensemble_weights_DXZ = custom_ensemble_weights,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The outcome variable.}

\item{D}{The binary endogenous variable of interest.}

\item{Z}{Binary instrumental variable.}

\item{X}{A (sparse) matrix of control variables.}

\item{learners}{May take one of two forms, depending on whether a single
learner or stacking with multiple learners is used for estimation of the
conditional expectation functions.
If a single learner is used, \code{learners} is a list with two named
elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{what} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{what}.}
}
If stacking with multiple learners is used, \code{learners} is a list of
lists, each containing four named elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{fun} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{fun}.}
\item{\code{assign_X} An optional vector of column indices
corresponding to control variables in \code{X} that are passed to
the base learner.}
\item{\code{assign_Z} An optional vector of column indices
corresponding to instruments in \code{Z} that are passed to the
base learner.}
}
Omission of the \code{args} element results in default arguments being
used in \code{fun}. Omission of \code{assign_X} (and/or \code{assign_Z})
results in inclusion of all variables in \code{X} (and/or \code{Z}).}

\item{learners_DXZ, learners_ZX}{Optional arguments to allow for different
estimators of \eqn{E[D \vert X, Z]}, \eqn{E[Z \vert X]}. Setup is
identical to \code{learners}.}

\item{sample_folds}{Number of cross-fitting folds.}

\item{ensemble_type}{Ensemble method to combine base learners into final
estimate of the conditional expectation functions. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"nnls"} Non-negative least squares.}
\item{\code{"nnls1"} Non-negative least squares with the constraint
that all weights sum to one.}
\item{\code{"singlebest"} Select base learner with minimum MSPE.}
\item{\code{"ols"} Ordinary least squares.}
\item{\code{"average"} Simple average over base learners.}
}
Multiple ensemble types may be passed as a vector of strings.}

\item{shortstack}{Boolean to use short-stacking.}

\item{cv_folds}{Number of folds used for cross-validation in ensemble
construction.}

\item{custom_ensemble_weights}{A numerical matrix with user-specified
ensemble weights. Each column corresponds to a custom ensemble
specification, each row corresponds to a base learner in \code{learners}
(in chronological order). Optional column names are used to name the
estimation results corresponding the custom ensemble specification.}

\item{custom_ensemble_weights_DXZ, custom_ensemble_weights_ZX}{Optional
arguments to allow for different
custom ensemble weights for \code{learners_DXZ},\code{learners_ZX}. Setup
is identical to \code{custom_ensemble_weights}. Note:
\code{custom_ensemble_weights} and
\code{custom_ensemble_weights_DXZ},\code{custom_ensemble_weights_ZX} must
have the same number of columns.}

\item{cluster_variable}{A vector of cluster indices.}

\item{subsamples_byZ}{List of two lists corresponding to the two instrument
levels. Each list contains vectors with sample indices for
cross-fitting.}

\item{cv_subsamples_byZ}{List of two lists, each corresponding to one of the
two instrument levels. Each of the two lists contains lists, each
corresponding to a subsample and contains vectors with subsample indices
for cross-validation.}

\item{trim}{Number in (0, 1) for trimming the estimated propensity scores at
\code{trim} and \code{1-trim}.}

\item{silent}{Boolean to silence estimation updates.}

\description{
Estimator of the local average treatment effect.
}
\details{
\code{ddml_late} provides a double/debiased machine learning
estimator for the local average treatment effect in the interactive model
given by

\eqn{Y = g_0(D, X) + U,}

where \eqn{(Y, D, X, Z, U)} is a random vector such that
\eqn{\operatorname{supp} D = \operatorname{supp} Z = \{0,1\}},
\eqn{E[U\vert X, Z] = 0}, \eqn{E[Var(E[D\vert X, Z]\vert X)] \neq 0},
\eqn{\Pr(Z=1\vert X) \in (0, 1)} with probability 1,
\eqn{p_0(1, X) \geq p_0(0, X)} with probability 1 where
\eqn{p_0(Z, X) \equiv \Pr(D=1\vert Z, X)}, and
\eqn{g_0} is an unknown nuisance function.

In this model, the local average treatment effect is defined as

\eqn{\theta_0^{\textrm{LATE}} \equiv
    E[g_0(1, X) - g_0(0, X)\vert p_0(1, X) > p(0, X)]}.
