\usage{
ddml_plm(
  y,
  D,
  X,
  learners,
  learners_DX = learners,

  ensemble_type = c("average"),
  cv_folds = 5,

\arguments{
\item{y}{A response vector.}

\item{D}{An endogeneous variable vector.}

\item{X}{A control matrix.}

\item{learners}{May take one of two forms, depending on whether a single model
should be used for residualization, or whether an ensemble procedure
should be employed.
If a single model should be used, \code{learners} is a list with two named
elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{what} The function used to trained the model. The
function must be such that it predicts a named input \code{y}
using a named input \code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{what}.}
}
If an ensemble should be used, \code{learners} is a list of lists, each
containing four named elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{fun} The function used to trained the model. The
function must be such that it predicts a named input \code{y}
using a named input \code{X}.}
\item{\code{assign_X} A vector of indices corresponding to features
in \code{X} that should be used for training.}
\item{\code{assign_Z} An optional vector of indices corresponding to
instruments in \code{Z} that should be used for training.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{fun}}
}}

\item{sample_folds}{The number of split sample folds used for calculation of
the out-of-sample predictions.}

\item{ensemble_type}{A string indicating the type of ensemble. Multiple types may
be passed in form of a vector of strings.}

\item{cv_folds}{The number for cross-validation folds.}

\item{subsamples}{An optional list of vectors, each containing indices of
a test-sample. If not used-provided, the split sample folds are randomly
drawn.}

\item{silent}{A boolean indicating whether current learners and folds should be
printed to the console.}

\item{setup_parallel}{An list containing details on the parallelization of
\code{crossval}.}
}
\value{
\code{ddml_plm} returns an object of S3 class
\code{ddml_plm}.

An object of class \code{ddml_plm}is a list containig the
following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{coef}}{A vector with the DDML PLM coefficent in the
first entry.}
\item{\code{...}}{...}
}
}
\description{
Compute DDML PLM estimators.
