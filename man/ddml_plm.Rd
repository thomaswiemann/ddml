\usage{
ddml_plm(
  y,
  D,
  X,
  learners,
  learners_DX = learners,
  sample_folds = 10,
  ensemble_type = "nnls",
  shortstack = FALSE,
  cv_folds = 10,
  custom_ensemble_weights = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The outcome variable.}

\item{D}{A matrix of endogenous variables.}

\item{X}{A (sparse) matrix of control variables.}

\item{learners}{May take one of two forms, depending on whether a single
learner or stacking with multiple learners is used for estimation of the
conditional expectation functions.
If a single learner is used, \code{learners} is a list with two named
elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{what} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{what}.}
}
If stacking with multiple learners is used, \code{learners} is a list of
lists, each containing four named elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{fun} The base learner function. The function must be
such that it predicts a named input \code{y} using a named input
\code{X}.}
\item{\code{args} Optional arguments to be passed to \code{fun}.}
\item{\code{assign_X} An optional vector of column indices
corresponding to control variables in \code{X} that are passed to
the base learner.}
}
Omission of the \code{args} element results in default arguments being
used in \code{fun}. Omission of \code{assign_X} results in inclusion of
all variables in \code{X}.}

\item{learners_DX}{Optional argument to allow for different estimators of
\eqn{E[D|X]}. Setup is identical to \code{learners}.}

\item{sample_folds}{Number of cross-fitting folds.}

\item{ensemble_type}{Ensemble method to combine base learners into final
estimate of the conditional expectation functions. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"nnls"} Non-negative least squares.}
\item{\code{"nnls1"} Non-negative least squares with the constraint
that all weights sum to one.}
\item{\code{"singlebest"} Select base learner with minimum MSPE.}
\item{\code{"ols"} Ordinary least squares.}
\item{\code{"average"} Simple average over base learners.}
}
Multiple ensemble types may be passed as a vector of strings.}

\item{shortstack}{Boolean to use short-stacking.}

\item{cv_folds}{Number of folds used for cross-validation in ensemble
construction.}

\item{custom_ensemble_weights}{A numerical matrix with user-specified
ensemble weights. Each column corresponds to a custom ensemble
specification, each row corresponds to a base learner in \code{learners}
(in chronological order). Optional column names are used to name the
estimation results corresponding the custom ensemble specification.}

\item{custom_ensemble_weights_DX}{Optional argument to allow for different
custom ensemble weights for \code{learners_DX}. Setup is identical to
\code{custom_ensemble_weights}. Note: \code{custom_ensemble_weights} and
\code{custom_ensemble_weights_DX} must have the same number of columns.}

\item{cluster_variable}{A vector of cluster indices.}

\item{subsamples}{List of vectors with sample indices for cross-fitting.}

\item{cv_subsamples_list}{List of lists, each corresponding to a subsample
containing vectors with subsample indices for cross-validation.}

\item{silent}{Boolean to silence estimation updates.}
}
\value{
\code{ddml_plm} returns an object of S3 class
\code{ddml_plm}. An object of class \code{ddml_plm} is a list containing
the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{coef}}{A vector with the \eqn{\theta_0} estimates.}
\item{\code{weights}}{A list of matrices, providing the weight
assigned to each base learner (in chronological order) by the
ensemble procedure.}
\item{\code{mspe}}{A list of matrices, providing the MSPE of each
base learner (in chronological order) computed by the
cross-validation step in the ensemble construction.}
\item{\code{ols_fit}}{Object of class \code{lm} from the second
stage regression of \eqn{Y - \hat{E}[Y|X]} on
\eqn{D - \hat{E}[D|X]}.}
\item{\code{learners},\code{learners_DX},\code{cluster_variable},
\code{subsamples}, \code{cv_subsamples_list},
\code{ensemble_type}}{Pass-through of selected user-provided
arguments. See above.}

\description{
Estimator for the partially linear model.
}
\details{
\code{ddml_plm} provides a double/debiased machine learning
estimator for the parameter of interest \eqn{\theta_0} in the partially
linear model given by

\eqn{Y = \theta_0D + g_0(X) + U,}

where \eqn{(Y, D, X, U)} is a random vector such that
\eqn{E[Cov(U, D\vert X)] = 0} and \eqn{E[Var(D\vert X)] \neq 0}, and
\eqn{g_0} is an unknown nuisance function.
