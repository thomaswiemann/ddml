\title{ddml: Double/Debiased Machine Learning in R}
\description{
Estimate common causal parameters using double/debiased machine
learning. 'ddml' simplifies estimation based on (short-)stacking, which
leverages multiple base learners to increase robustness to the underlying
data generating process.
