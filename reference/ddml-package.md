# ddml: Double/Debiased Machine Learning in R

Estimate common causal parameters using double/debiased machine learning
as proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018). 'ddml' simplifies estimation
based on (short-)stacking, which leverages multiple base learners to
increase robustness to the underlying data generating process.
